# 🏥 Hospital Management System[in development]

A simple yet effective **Hospital Management System** built using **Java**, **MySQL**, and **Gradle**, applying strong **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. This project was developed for **learning purposes**, with an emphasis on clean architecture, modular design, and backend database integration.

## ✨ Project Overview

This system is designed to simulate core hospital operations such as:

- 📋 Patient registration and record management  
- 👔 Employee management
- 🔍 Database queries and reports

It demonstrates how core concepts of **Java OOP**, such as **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**, can be used to structure real-world systems.
