# 🏥 Hospital Management System[in development]

A simple yet effective **Hospital Management System** built using **Java**, **MySQL**, and **Gradle**, applying strong **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. This project was developed for **learning purposes**, with an emphasis on clean architecture, modular design, and backend database integration.

## ✨ Project Overview

This system is designed to simulate core hospital operations such as:

- 📋 Patient registration and record management  
- 👔 Employee management
- 🔍 Database queries and reports

It demonstrates how core concepts of **Java OOP**, such as **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**, can be used to structure real-world systems.

## 🧑‍💼 For Recruiters

This project reflects:

- 🔹 My proficiency in **Java and backend development**
- 🔹 My understanding of **relational databases**
- 🔹 My ability to write **clean, modular, and object-oriented code**
- 🔹 My experience using **build tools** and **version control**

> I built this system to strengthen my backend programming fundamentals and simulate a real-world project scenario. I am open to feedback and eager to grow through team-based development experiences.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   -open up the powershell(on windows),bash(on Linux)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hospitalmanagement.git
   cd hospitalmanagement
   ```
2. **Take sample database to mysql(mysql should be installed with aswin as a user with password "psupsc")**
   **Also enter "psupsc" as the password when prompted*,this sql uses hashing to protect its passwords admin is the full privilaged username and its password is "ak".*
3. ```bash
   mysql - u aswin -p
   create database JAVA
   mysqldump -u yourusername -p "JAVA" < mysqlfiles/hospitaldb.sql   
   ```
   > Note: Powershell should not be used to run the mysqldump command as it does not support ">" character.
   > Alternatives: windows users can again open cmd in that folder and do that command or use bash(git bash or wsl).
3. **Run the jar file provided(JAVA should be installed and this **jar file should be used exactly**)**
  -type this command on the Command Line Interface(CLI)
   ```bash
   java -jar build/libs/HospitalDB-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
   ```

> Note: The `build/` folder and `.jar` file are included for demonstration purposes.  
> In real-world production code, these would be excluded via `.gitignore` and generated as needed using Gradle.
